For Dijkstra Algorithm->
    Input: Graph and a Source
    Output: Distance Source to all Nodes.

Pseudocode:
    1. Create a visited array V[N] // N means const size
    2. Create a distance array d[N] // N means const size
        -> set all value of d[N] to Infinity
        -> set d[src]=0
        -> set v[nodes]=0
    3. Run a loop 0 to less than nodes-1 
        -> check either the nodes are visited or not.
        -> if visited then we ignore the node
        -> then find the smallest node distance
        -> at last make the selected node v[selected]=1 //that means the node is visited
    4. Then run a loop for all adjacent nodes of selected node
        -> then use a simple equation 
            -> distance of selected node + cost of(selected node to the next node) < distance of node
            -> look like
                -> d[selected]+cost < d[node]
                -> if the condition is true then update the value of d[node] with d[selected]+cost
    5. at last return the distance array
